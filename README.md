# Novel Reads Bookstore Project
Spring Project for CSCI4300 Web Development

Description:
This web application is a small-scale library that hosts public domain literature that can be rented for consumption.

Books will be read via a browser's built-in PDF viewer.

This site hosts a generous collection of famous fiction, non-fiction and philosophical works from great minds of the past.

This site has been tested on Firefox and Chrome via DevTools.

How to run:
XAMPP is required to run this website on a browser.
Load the main folder into XAMPP's 'htdocs/' directiory.

Enter the IP address provided by XAMPP into your browser
and enter the path to file in the URL bar.
Format: [ip]/[path-to-file.php]
Ex: http://192.168.64.2/4300-Group-Project-Bookstore/html&php/index.php

You can also enable localhost in the 'Network' tab in XAMPP and use that instead of the IP.
